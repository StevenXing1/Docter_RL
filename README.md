# Doctor Agent for Hypotension Management using Reinforcement Learning
# Overview
This project focuses on the development of an AI-driven doctor agent specialized in managing hypotension issues. Utilizing state-of-the-art Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques, our goal is to train a model that can suggest optimal interventions in response to various hypotension scenarios.

# Background
Hypotension, or low blood pressure, can lead to various health complications. Timely and effective management is crucial in a clinical setting. This project aims to aid medical professionals by providing decision support for hypotension management.

# Installation

For environment, all the packages are included in requirements.txt file. Also need basic packages like torch for machine learning.
